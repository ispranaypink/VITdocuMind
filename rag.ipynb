Preamble\\nPresent day student is much different from the students of the past in many w ays. Students like to\\nmake decisions on their own and like to plan their future by themselves. However, student\\naspirations on one hand and the demands of the work place on the other have become highly\\ndiverse. Employers expect students to have multi-disciplinary competency, leadership skills, and be\\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) ready and skilled in artificial intelligence.\\nAs part of continuous improvement in providing quality education, during 2008, VIT University has \\nintroduced the Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCS™) into its academic curriculum. By this, the students \\ncan register courses of their choice and alter the pace of learning within the broad framework of \\nacademic course and credit requirements. FFCS allows students to decide their academic plan and \\npermits students to alter it as they progress in time. \\nAnother milestone in implementing FFCS is moving from a fixed time table to a slot based timetable. \\nUnder this, a student will be able to choose the time he/she wants to attend a theory class/ lab. Thus, \\ncombining FFCS with a slot based timetable, students can make their own time table and student in \\na class may have a different timetable of his/her own. In order to make the learning more effective, \\nthe students appl y the course principles by using analytical and critical thinking and thus have an \\nopportunity to carry out challenging project(s) as part of the curriculum. \\nStudents also have the option of choosing courses from a ‘basket of courses’ within each \\nclassification. Ample options are given to choose interdisciplinary courses from other programmes \\nwhich will help the student to develop additional skills. Slow learners will also be benefitted since \\nimportant courses are offered in both semesters. This arrangement helps the students to re-register \\nthe course and clear the backlog in the subsequent semester. Suitable provisions are included to \\nreward academically sound students and to carry out research activities even in their UG Programme. \\nFFCS offers not only wide choice for students to build their own curriculum, but also enhances their \\nskill in planning. A Proctor / faculty advisor helps the student in identifying the courses to be studied \\nin each semester based on programme requirement, course prerequisites, student’s academic ability \\nand interest in various disciplines, past academic history, proposed course offerings and other \\nrelated criteria. \\nFFCS Academic Regulations - Version 4.0'),\n",

Learning becomes more \\n‘experiential’ by carrying out project s as part of the curriculum. ‘Learning by doing’ enhances \\nunderstanding the concepts discussed in the class and make multi - and cross - disciplinary \\napplications possible. Students will be able to take up real world problems as their course projects \\nand apply their key learning in identifying better solutions. All courses were designed  to bring out \\nthe importance of application to engineering/technological problems, creativity and innovation, \\ndeveloping entrepreneurial skills, rather than rote learning.  \\n2. Scope\\nThe rules and regulations stated herein shall be called “FFCS Academic Regulations Version 4.0”.\\nThese regulations are applicable to students admitted from the academic year 2021 - 22 onwards to\\nall the programmes  in the institute .

For Project course, the student has to take up a project related \\nto the course in consultation with the faculty concerned and complete the project . The project can \\nbe a group project with a maximum of five  members in a group. The size will reflect the complexity \\nof the project. Students should make sure that the concepts studied are reflected in the project and \\nthat there is an innovative component. There will be a minimum of three reviews conducted in a \\nsemester and the marks will be awarded and taken for final grading.  \\n \\n4.7 Course code  \\nEach course will be identified by a unique Course Code of eight alpha-numerals (Four alphabets \\nfollowed by 3  digits and ended with 1 alphabet ). The alphabets reflect the discipline to which the \\ncourse belongs. The first numeral (after the alphabet) indicates the cognitive level of the course, and \\nthe rest of the numerals indicate a running serial number. Each course also has its version to track  \\nthe revisions carried out in its syllabus over the time. \\n \\n5. Programme Duration \\nThe minimum duration that the students are generally expected to take to meet various \\nrequirements of programmes offered by the University is given in Annexure – 1. A student is said to \\nhave completed the programme only if he / she completes the minimum courses assigned and earns \\ncredit requirements as specified in their programme curriculum concerned. However, degree will be \\nawarded only upon the completion of the minimum duration of the programme as prescribed by \\nUGC. The general rules and regulations stipulated in this document are also applicable to the double \\nand dual degree programmes offered by the University and other special programmes announced \\nby the University.

A semester is deemed \\nto have 15 instructional (non-exam) weeks. A class room lecture (L) of 50 minutes duration per week, \\ncarried out during all weeks of the semester, shall be considered as one Instructional Unit or one \\nCredit. A tutorial (T) of 50 minutes duration per week, carried out during all weeks of the semester, \\nshall be considered as one Instructional Unit or one Credit. A minimum of 100 minutes per week of \\nlaboratory session/ practical or field work/ training (P) or a combination of these, carried out during \\nall weeks of the semester, shall also be considered as one Instructional Unit or one Credit. Thus, the \\nLTPC for each course indicate s the number of credits delivered as Lecture (L ), Tutorial (T), Practical \\n(P) and the total instructional delivery indicated as Credits (C). \\n \\nExample: \\nAn LTPC of 2-1-2-4 means 2 instructional units based on class room lecture (L), one instructional unit \\nof tutorial (T), one laboratory (P) based instructional u nit (of 100 minutes)  - all delivered during a \\ncalendar week, and repeated for the entire duration of the semester to earn four credit (C) after \\npassing the course. \\n \\n6.2  Minimum Credit Requirement \\nThe minimum credit requirement for the completion of a programme for students admitted is clearly \\nspecified in the programme curriculum. Further, the student has to meet the course and credit \\ndistribution under various heads as specified under 4.2, as specified in  the curriculum to become \\neligible for the degree. Due to various features of FFCS, it is possible for a student to attain the \\nminimum credit requirement without completing all requisite courses/credits under individual heads \\nlike Foundation Core (FC) , Discipline Linked Engineering Courses (DLE) , Discipline Core (DC) , Discipline \\nElective (DE) / Specialization Elective (SE) , Open Elective (OE), Skill Enhancement Courses (SEC), Ability \\nEnhancement Courses (AEC) and Project and Internship  as defined in the ir curriculum. Under such \\ncircumstances, though the student has attained the minimum credits, it is mandatory for the student \\nto complete all courses under FC, DLE and DC and also to meet the credit requirements under OE / DE \\n/ SE / SEC / AEC  and other heads as per Section 4.2. to become eligible for the degree. \\n \\n \\n \\nFFCS Academic Regulations - Version 4.0'),\n",

These courses are \\nbasic in nature and are expected to enhance student’s knowledge in various discipline s apart from \\nhis/her own discipline. FC  courses may be added, removed or modified from time to time by the \\nAcademic Council. In few cases, a minimum credit requirement may be fixed to be met by taking one \\nor more courses offered in a basket. \\nExample: FC specifies that each student should take a foreign language course(s)  and Humanities, \\nScience and Management (HSM) Electives . This can be met by taking any course offered from a \\nbasket of foreign language courses and basket of HSM Electives. \\n \\n6.3.2  Discipline Core (DC) \\nCourses listed under DC of a curriculum are mandatory to the specific programme. Students have to \\ncomplete all the courses listed under DC to become eligible for the degree. No substitution of a \\ncourse listed under DC by another course is permitted. \\n \\n6.3.3 Discipline Elective (DE)/Specialization Elective (SE) \\nBy taking courses under DE / SE , students get an opportunity to study courses which are more \\nadvanced or applied or specialized than the basic courses he/she studies as part of DC courses. These \\ncourses will generally provide an in-depth knowledge of a specific sub-field the student has taken as \\nhis/her maj or specialization. DE courses need not be restricted to his/ her major specialization  \\nwhereas SE is restricted to the basket defined. DE / SE courses that are not offered to students in a \\ngiven academic year or that have low student registration for two consecutive academic years will \\nbe removed. DE / SE courses play a crucial role in offering Honours . If a new DE / SE is  added to a \\nsubsequent curriculum of a programme, students adopting the earlier curriculum applicable to their \\nyear of joining are also permitted to register the same as their DE / SE, since it ultimately helps them \\nto expand their knowledge.  \\nFFCS Academic Regulations - Version 4.0'),\n",

This work may be related \\nto the specialization of the programme the student undergoes, by applying the knowledge they have \\ngained in the courses/ labs they have undergone as on that date. Through the project work, students \\nare expected to prove their analytical, design, fabrication ability and presentation skills. Depending \\non the nature of the project work, an individual student or a group of students may carry out the \\nproject within the Universit y or outside, viz. in an industry, private/ government organization, or \\nacademic/ research institution. Each student will be assigned a faculty member as guide within their \\nSchool. In suitable cases, with the permission of HoD, the student may opt for a guide outside their \\nSchool also. In case of projects outside the University, there will be an external guide within the \\nindustry/ organization of work and an internal guide within the School to which the student belongs \\nto. In case of group project, the indi vidual project report of each student in that group shall have \\ndifferent project title to bring out the individual’s contribution to the group project. Submitting a \\nproject that was bought (purchased)/ borrowed/ submitted in “VIT” or another University/ \\nInstitution shall be considered as examination malpractice and will be awarded an ‘N’ grade and the \\nstudent has to register again and clear the student project in a subsequent semester. Failure or \\nabsence in the final viva- voce examination results in re -registration of the project. Though group \\nproject is permitted at undergraduate level programmes, students of post graduate programme are \\nexpected to carry out individual projects independently. Wherever needed, periodic reviews can be \\nconducted through video - conferencing. However, final viva voce examination will be conducted in \\nperson only. \\nStudents are expected to decide on the specific project area and title, and carry out substantial \\nportion of the literature survey during the end of their pre-final semester. After the end of their pre-\\nfinal semester FATs, the student need to make a presentation to the “Student Project Monitoring \\nCommittee” constituted by Schools concerned. The Project Work may be a work based on theoretical \\nanalysis, modeling & simulation, experimentation & analysis, prototype design, fabrication of new \\nequipment and analysis of data, etc. or a combination of these. Various time limits specified for \\nmonitoring and evaluation of performance of the student should be strictly followed ( Table 1). The \\nfinal project report will be evaluated by a panel of examiners consisting of HoD as Chairman of the \\nCommittee, External Examiner, one Internal Expert, Guide and Co- guide (wherever applicable) and \\nan oral examination will be conducted.

Students shall register courses offered in each semester and \\nclear them, subject to various conditions as prescribed in this Regulation. The list of courses offered \\nby each programme will be announced prior to the registration. Depending on academic and non -\\nacademic resources available to each programme, courses offered may vary. Students will get a \\nchance to make their own plan of study by changing the pace with which they study (fast/slow).

The \\nProctor will discuss with the student on his/her academic performance in previous semester(s) and \\nsuggest the number and nature of courses to be registered in the ensuing semester, within the \\nframework of that programme curriculum . The feature “Student Curriculum” is present in the \\nacademic portal. If the Proctor enters the register number of a student, it is possible to view his/her \\ncurriculum applicable to that year (latest version). In addition, the student’s final grades obtained in \\nvarious courses will also be displayed. This would help the Proctor to guide students to register \\ncourses under his/her curriculum. Students having backlogs or under probation may get advice for \\npacing the programme accordingly. \\n \\n7.2 Bridge Courses \\nDuring the first semester of the study period, the courses prescribed for the first semester alone will \\nbe registered by the School Academic Coordinator for all the students of all the programmes offered \\nby the University. Further, d epending on the proficiency in language and other necessary \\nfundamental disciplines, the student may be asked to undergo some special courses (bridge courses), \\nas recommended by his/her programme curriculum, to compensate his/her inadequacy. These \\ncourses will be recommended based on a screening test conducted by the University or based on the \\nsubjects student had completed during his/her  previous qualifying school examinations. Such \\ncourses will also be registered automatically and will appear in the student’s timetable. The credits \\nand grades so obtained will not be counted for the CGPA calculation / towards the minimum credit \\nrequirements for the completion of the programme as specified in Section 6.2. \\n \\n7.3   Minimum/ Maximum Credit Limits for Course Registration \\nThe number of c redits most students are expected to register in a semester will be 23 (Average \\nAcademic Load) so that they complete the programme within the specified duration of the \\nprogramme. However, a student can register for a maximum of 27 credits or a minimum of 16 credits \\nin a regular semester (other than during summer and weekend Intra  semesters). Under no \\ncircumstances a student, whether regular or timed -out, will be permitted to cross these limits. \\nHowever, a student carrying out the last registration of his/her programme will be permitted to \\nregister less than 16 credits in order to meet the minimum credit requirements for the completion \\nof programme.

If the courses are offered and if there is no clash in time table, the student is \\npermitted to register any number of courses.  \\n \\n7.4 Registering for Backlog Courses \\nStudents who have not cleared one or more component(s) of a course (Theory/ Lab) are shown with \\n“N” grade. If a student clears all the components individually but if the grand total of that course does \\nnot meet the passing range then \"F\" grade is awarded. A course having an ‘F’ grade will be considered \\nas a backlog and it has to be re - registered in the subsequent semesters. Students with F grade in \\ncourses are eligible to register the next level course (pre-requisite is met). If the student has cleared \\nthe theory component, but has N grade, he/she will be permitted to register the next level course \\n(pre-requisite is met). Both F and N have to be cleared by re -registering the same course in the \\nsubsequent regular semester/ summer semester / weekend intra semester. If a student has not \\ncleared all the components (F Grade) (or) if the student opts for Grade Improvement then the course \\nhas to be completely (wholly) re- registered in all its components. On the other hand, if the student \\nhas cleared in one or more components but got N grade in that course, then the cleared components \\nare exempted from re-registration. Re-registration fee will be as per the university norms existing at \\nthe time of re-registration (whole or a component of a course). When a course is re-registered wholly, \\nall earlier course evaluation marks shall be treated as cancelled/ reset. If a student fails in a course \\ndue to lack of marks in the lab component of an embedded course, the student has to re-register the \\nlab/project component alone. Courses having ‘W’ grade will not be considered as backlog. Students \\nwho are debarred from writing FAT will be given “N” grade, for that course, in the grade sheet.  To \\nprovide an early opportunity f or students to clear their backlog of courses, efforts will be made to \\noffer as many courses as possible during fall, winter, weekend intra and summer semesters. \\n \\nStudents have to pay a Re-registration fee, as specified by the University from time to time,  for the \\nfollowing cases: 1) registration of a course for which ‘N’ or ‘F’ or ‘W’ is given, or 2) registering a DE/OE \\n(either same course or a substitution course) which was not cleared in the previous semester(s). \\n \\n \\nFFCS Academic Regulations - Version 4.0'),\n",

If a student fails to clear the course through arrear examination option and if he \\nwishes to clear through re -registration, then the student should register for all the components of \\nthe course. \\n  \\n7.5 Add/Drop of Courses \\nOption to add o r drop a course (from the registered courses) is given during the first three \\ninstructional days of the semester (not applicable to summer / weekend semesters), subject to the \\navailability of resources and the minimum/ maximum number of credits required to be registered in \\na semester as specified in Section 7.3. Only those courses that stand registered at the end of \\nAdd/Drop process will be considered as final for that semester. The courses thus dropped will not \\nappear in the semester Grade Sheet of the stu dent. The ‘dropped’ courses can be taken in the \\nfollowing semester when the courses are offered. Add/Drop provision is not available for the courses \\nregistered during weekend intra  / summer semester, in view of their short duration. Add/ Drop is \\nonly an option given to the student. While exercising this option, if the student adds a new course \\nthen the student’s attendance is calculated from the date of adding the course. If he/she drops the \\ncourse and again adds the same course then the attendance is calculated from the first date of adding \\nthe course and no compensation/ transfer of attendance shall be permitted. There is no re -\\nregistration fee for registering a ‘Dropped’ course again. \\n \\n7.6 Course Withdrawal \\nIf a student feels that his/her performance in C AT-I of a registered course is not satisfactory, the \\nstudent can withdraw his/her Course Registration from the course. After finalization of CAT-I marks, \\nthe University will announce suitable days for carrying out Course Withdrawal. Course Withdrawal \\nwill be open to students for three instructional days. Withdrawal below 16 credits is, generally, not \\npermitted. However, final years and timed -out students are exempted from the minimum \\nwithdrawal credit limit. Re -registered courses cannot be withdrawn, except those re- registered \\ncourses that have been cleared subsequently. If a registered additional/ re-registered course is \\nwithdrawn, no refund will be made. A course once withdrawn through this process cannot be \\nreinstated again.

While withdrawing a course, students need \\nto pay the re-registration charges as applicable and only if the fee is paid within a stipulated date the \\ncourse withdrawal becomes effective. \\n \\n7.7 Course Prerequisites \\nSome courses may have specific prerequisites to be met before a student can register for the course. \\nGenerally the student is expected to have cleared all the prerequisite courses at the time of Course \\nRegistration. Students who had received an ‘F’ grade in a prerequisite course are also permitted to \\nregister the next level course by assuming that they had attained the required ‘exposure’ by \\nattending that course. In case the student has met the minimum attendance as stipulated in Section \\n8, eligible to write the FAT and also has written the FAT of a prerequisite course, but the result for \\nthe course is not yet declared (but not withheld) by the University, it will be assumed that the student \\nhas met the prerequisite condition by obtaining the required ‘exposure’ in that course. Under such \\ncircumstances, the student is permitted to  register a higher level course having this course as \\nprerequisite. Subsequently, when the results are declared by the University and if the student is \\nawarded an ‘F’ grade in the course which was a prerequisite course, the Registration made for the \\nhigher level course will not be cancelled. This stand is adopted so that the student can make further \\nprogress towards earning credits and his/her progress need not be pulled down by backlog courses.  \\nSimilar to prerequisite, a course may have an anti-requisite and/ or co-requisite. When two courses \\nhaving almost similar/ same course contents and considered as equivalent are made available to a \\nstudent to choose, and to prevent students crediting both the courses, the anti-requisite option can \\nbe used. Similarly, an independent laboratory course can be coupled to a theory -alone cours e \\nthrough a co-requisite thereby forcing a student to register both the courses together. \\n \\n8. Attendance \\nA student is expected to maintain 100% attendance in all courses. Considering the fact that a student \\nmay need leave due to ill -health or to attend some f amily emergency, a student is permitted to \\nmaintain an attendance of 75% (i.e. absent for 25% of instructional hours) in each course, without \\nproducing any proof for the absence. This 25% absence includes medical, personnel, casual, official \\nleave of absen ce for organizing events/ seminars/ workshops/ technical/ cultural \\nfestivals/competitions/ participation in co-curricular/ extra-curricular events/ NSS & NCC camps, any \\nother (valid or otherwise) reason.

The attendance software shall indicate the student status of that exam component as \\n‘Debarred’ once the student crosses below the minimum attendance requirement. Students who are \\n‘debarred’ from writing the FAT component of a course shall be awarded an “N” grade and they have \\nto re-register the course again and clear with a performance grade.

For this purpose, the nine -\\npointers list will be dynamically generated and applied at the time of preparation of debarred list of \\neach exam component (CAT/FAT) of a course. Hence the exemption status may change before any \\nexam component depending on the declaration of results. However, no retrospective effect will be \\ngiven to earlier decisions of inclusion/ exclusion from debarred list based on the CGPA the students \\nhad at that time.

Majority  of  students  scoring  very  low  marks  because  of  either  the question paper is \\ntough or the evaluator is very strict. \\nIn this system, grades are awarded to students according to their performance relative to their peers \\nin the same class (class is defined as a unique combination of course-slot-faculty). Normally the class \\naverage mark is taken as midpoint of ‘B’ grade, and relative to this and depending on the sigma (σ, \\nstandard deviation) value, the other grades are finalized as given in Table -5.

On completion of the \\nprogramme, a suitable grade will be awarded and the CGPA will be calculated accordingly at the time \\nof issue of the Consolidated Grade Sheet. However, the student needs to pay the course registration \\ncharges for the course(s) as per the prevailing charges at the end of the programme.  \\nProgramme wise rank list will be prepared based on CGPA only. In case of a tie in t he CGPA, same \\nrank will be awarded to all in tie.

Course Equivalence \\nRegular updating of curriculum and syllabi is essential to reflect advancements made in various fields. \\nThe students who have studied the courses of previous curriculum are permitted to register courses \\nof current curriculum. The FFCS permits a student to register a course at any time or re -register a \\ncourse again to clear their backlog. By the time a student registers a course or re-registers next time, \\nthere could be some modifications carried out in the syllabus of course(s) and a new syllabus version \\nthat is different to the version indicated in his/her curriculum be currently offered to students. If the \\nchanges effected are marginal, both the syllabi are considered to be equivalent and the student \\nregistering first time or re -registering the course has to undertake the new syllabi currently being \\noffered. No separate classes with the older version of syllabus will be offered to the student to clear \\ntheir backlog. After careful study of syllabi, the Course Committee may also identify new courses \\nconsidered equivalent to those courses that were dropped from the curriculum for various reasons. \\nBased on the recommendations of the Course Committee, Dean of the programme School shall \\ndeclare such courses as equivalent and the same may be recommended. Course equivalence is \\napplicable to all curricula, present and the future. However, the number of credits to be earned \\ncannot be altered and all conditions specified in Section 6 need to be adhered. All different versions \\nof the same course are considered equivalent. Credits of the original course (of the curriculum) will \\nbe considered as ‘earned’, if there is a credit difference to the equivalent course.

Honours Club \\nStudents who maintain a CGPA of 9.25 and above, having no ‘F’ grade to their credit and  have never \\nbeen  debarred  for lack of attendance in  any CAT/ any component of continuous assessment/ FAT \\nor indiscipline, will be admitted into the Honours Club for their meritorious performance.
